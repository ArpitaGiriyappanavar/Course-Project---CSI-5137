# Course-Project---CSI-5137
Course project - CSI 5137 - University of Ottawa. Topic: "Hyperparameter Tuning of Neural Network using Genetic Algorithm and Bayesian Optimization

The github folder consists of 4 files which contains both, the implementation of Neural Network using Genetic Algorithm and Bayesian Optimization. The .ipynb files are the Google colab notebooks which can be uploaded on Google Colab and just press run.

There are .py files which needs you to clone this project in your system. Installations are specified below:

For GA:
`pip install deap`
`python Genetic_Algorithm-NN.py` 

For BO:
`pip install bayesian-optimization`
`pip install gpy gpyopt`
`python Bayesian_optimization-NN.py`

Make sure you have the latest version of python installed in your system.
